        A few weeks ago, I saw my dad and sister play an online tower defense
        game. One of the minigames is Memory, the classic card matching game.
      </p>

      <p>
        During each turn, you choose a card to flip, then try to find the
        matching card in the deck. This ends your turn. If the cards match, you
        win an in-game item. If not, then the cards are flipped back over. The
        game continues until you have either gotten all the matches or run out
        of turns.
      </p>

      <p>
        This got me thinking about Memory, combinatorics, and the number of
        matches you would expect to get for n number of flips. I decided to
        create a game simulator to find the result.

      <h2>How To</h2>
      <p>
        Memory is an easy game to play. There are a few variations of the game,
        but we are going to choose the simplest one. In this version of Memory,
        we will assume the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            There is only one player
          </li>
          <li>
            The player's goal is to flip the most number of matches in the turns
            allotted
          </li>
          <li>
            Each card in the deck is paired with only one other card
          </li>
          <li>
            The player has perfect memory! Once he/she sees a card, he/she always
            knows where it is.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on our assumptions, we can figure out the optimal strategy:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Beginning each turn, the player will first remember if any two cards
            he/she previously revealed match. If so, then he/she will flip those two
            matching cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            If not, the player will flip the next available card. If that card
            matches a previously revealed card, the player will flip the matching
            card, giving a match.
          </li>
          <li>
            If not, the player will flip the next available card and hope that
            it matches. The turn ends.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>Trials:1, Pairs: 5, Turns: 6
        <div class="card">E</div>
        <div class="card">C</div>
        <div class="card">A</div>
        <div class="card">C</div>
        <div class="card">E</div>
        <div class="card">D</div>
        <div class="card">D</div>
        <div class="card">B</div>
        <div class="card">A</div>
        <div class="card">B</div>
        <ol>
          Turns
          <li>
            The player flips cards E and C (index: 0, 1). No match. Matches = 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player flips cards A and C (index: 2, 3). No match. Matches = 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player flips cards C and C (index: 3, 1). Match! Matches = 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player flips cards E and E (index: 4, 0). Match! Matches = 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player flips cards D and D (index: 5, 6). Match! Matches = 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player flips cards B and A (index: 7, 8). No match. Matches = 3.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Result: 3 matches
